# Tic Tac Toe README
## GA Boston WDI28 Project 1
## By: Eshan Misra

### Planning/Approach

Upon starting this project, I relied on my wireframe/outline to help me mentally plot out what I needed to build, and the functionality that I needed to (at least try to) create for it. I'm a very visual thinker, so it helped me to have that wireframe, and it's also why building the physical "gameboard" was one of the first things I did.

Just having that board in front of me helped to make it easier for me to mentally chart things out. Also, not for nothing, the small feeling of accomplishment one gets from small victories in the face of such a complicated project can be very important; keeping your spirits bouyed is essential if you to persevere through rough patches.

The hardest part overall for me, was mentally understanding the relationship between the api and the code I was writing. Having your information be communicated to it, and pulling information from it was difficult at first, but I got used to it more and more and feel very happy with the project I have ended up with. It may not be perfect, and I certainly plan on making improvments to it in the coming weeks, but I am quite proud of what I've been able to do so far.
