# Tic Tac Toe README
## GA Boston WDI28 Project 1

### Planning/Approach

Upon starting this project, I relied on my wireframe/outline to help me mentally plot out what I needed to build, and the functionality that I needed to (at least try to) create for it. I'm a very visual thinker, so it helped me to have that wireframe, and it's also why building the physical "gameboard" was one of the first things I did.

Just having that board in front of me helped to make it easier for me to mentally chart things out. Also, not for nothing, the small feeling of accomplishment one gets from small victories in the face of such a complicated project can be very important; keeping your spirits bouyed is essential if you are to persevere through rough patches.

The hardest part overall, for me, was mentally understanding the relationship between the api and the code I was writing. Having your information be communicated to it, and pulling information from it was difficult at first, but I got used to it more and more and feel very happy with the project I have ended up with. It may not be perfect, and I certainly plan on making improvments to it in the coming weeks, but I am quite proud of what I've been able to do so far.

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to be able to sign up for new account with email and password
* As a user, I want to be able to sign in after creating an account
* As a user, I want the option to change my password when signed in
* As a user, I want an error message if I did something incorrectly
* As a user, I don't want to see the gameboard until I press a play/new game button
* As a user, I want to be able to play just by clicking on grid I want
* As a user, I want to know who's turn it is (x or o)
* As a user, I want to be notified when there's a win (or a tie)
* As a user, I want to know who that winner is.
* As a user, after I finish a game, I want to be able to easily restart a new game
* As a user, I want to be able to find out how many games have been played
* As a user, I want to be able to sign out, ensuring that no one can play on my account or change my password

### Future Improvements/Plans

In the coming weeks/months, I plan to return to this project and improve it for my portfolio. No concrete plans yet necessarily, but I plan to revisit the styling (I like the color/font choices I made, but I can certainly add some fancier styling features.) Maybe mike the sign up/in fields modals than slide down from a nav bar, or disappear/reappear in a more visually impressive manner. I'd also like to fix the positioning of the actual gameboard on my page (make it more centered, ideally). Just some examples of things I hope to improve.
